# Mailing List

Celix users and developers can be reached using mailing lists. Currently there is only one list for development and 
support questions.

- [Celix Developers Mailing List](mailto:dev@celix.apache.org)
    - [Subscribe](mailto:dev-subscribe@celix.apache.org)
    - [Unsubscribe](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@celix.apache.org)
    - [Archives](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/celix-dev/)
    
If the Celix community grows, and there is a need for a dedicated users mailing list, it will be created.

There is a second mailing list which is used to publish changes from the 
[Issue Tracker](/support/issuetracking.html).

- [Celix Commits Mailing List](mailto:commits@celix.apache.org)
    - [Subscribe](mailto:commits-subscribe@celix.apache.org)
    - [Unsubscribe](mailto:commits-unsubscribe@celix.apache.org)
    - [Archives](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/celix-commits/)
